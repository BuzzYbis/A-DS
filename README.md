## What is this project ? 

At the beginning, thhis repository was just a gathering of my notes of the wonderfull course [Algorithm and Data Structure](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS21S1jm43igE57Ye_edwds_iL7ZOAG4) from Pavel Marvin. The course is on youtube and home-tasks are given in a CodeForces blog entry that is available from the description. 
_Note: that since I am not a Russian speaker, I followed the english course but it is also available in Russian if you want to check it for yourself. Which is highly recommended._ 

But as my notes corpus were getting bigger I thought of using my notes from the course as a source material to make a collaborative algorithms and data structures course. 

The idea is instead of having one or two professors making a course for their university and repeat this scheme for every university, I would like to gather professors and algorithm enthusiasts that want to contribute to make only one big course on algorithms. 

This one big course would allow people to learn from a common base that is more furnished and evolving from year to year. And it would allow people that use this course to teach to focus on contributing to this course and making it evolving with the latest discoveries as the base material is already there. 

## Presentation of the source material 

This course is articulated in 4 semesters which represent 59 videos (almost 15 per semester) and 2 bonus videos. It also comes with a home task for almost every lecture that is composed from 5 to 10 questions on the topics of the lectures. 

## Release 

Since this project is meant to be an evolving course and aim to be used one day as a material for university course I want to make a release that follows the beginning of academic years. 

Therefore, after the completion of the notes of the source material, there will be at least one release in June / July to have an up-to-date version for the beginning of the next year. 

Since some country does not follow the August / September -> May / June school year if the community is sufficient to make the course evolve fast, there will be two releases: 
* 1 around January
* 1 around June / July

This release will be offering a compiled version of all the Lectures, Exercises, Slides (see future projects)... disponible in the repository.

If you want to integrate a specific part in your course without waiting for the next release, you can recompile the said document yourself by cloning the repository.

## Contribution 

As per say in the presentation of the project, this is meant to be a collaborative course. Contribution are therefore more than welcome. 

Contributing can be done from many manners: 
* You find an error in the text of a lecture or exercise:
  * Open an issue with the tag `mistake` and the tag of the related lecture with the corresponding tag `S1L1` for lecture 1 of semester 1 etc and the tag `home-task` if the mistake is related to an home task.
  * Then explain why you think there is a mistake with a demonstration or sources and PR your correction.
* You want to add detail or a part in a Lecture:
  * Open an issue the tag `enhancement` and the tag of the related lecture with the corresponding tag `S1L1` for lecture 1 of semester 1 etc.
  * Explain why you want to add this detail and PR this change with your sources if you have some.
* You want to work on the openened issues related to future project:
  * Assign the issue to you and begin to work.  

If you never worked with typst: 
* This is an alternative to LateX made to simpler to use for newcomer.
* [Documentation](https://typst.app/docs/)
* [Forum](https://forum.typst.app/)
* To contribute, you have two choices, import the project in the Typst web app or just put the project on your machine and use your IDE to make your modifications. If you have VSC you can use the [Tinymist typst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension. 

## Future goals 

After all the lectures and home tasks from the source material will have been included in the project. 

### Detail, add information and further reading <detail>
  - #### Goal
    Add details and other information that would enhance the source material course of Pavel Marvin and add further reading to allow people / students to dive and go deeper into a subject easily.
  - #### Why?
    There is always room for improvement and more explanations in a course.
  
  _See the enhancement and further reading tagged issues (and projects)._

### Slides
  - #### Goal
    Make slides for each lecture of this course
  - #### Why?
    This would allow professors to have a presentation that goes with the lecture notes of this repository.

  _See slides tagged issues (and project)._ 

### Exercises, problem sets and home tasks
  - #### Goal
    Add more problem sets and exercises in supplement of the ones from the source material
  - #### Why?
    Practice is necessary and having multiple exercises coming from different people and point of view is better.

  _See exercises tagged issues (and projects)._

### Implementation and real world applications
  - #### Goal 
    Having implementations and real world usage for the algorithms and data structures presented in the course.
  - #### Why? 
    Because in order to learn, having examples can reveal to be very useful. 

  _No issues or project defined for this for now as it is for later in the roadmap (for when the community around the project will not be just me)._

### Specialisation
  - #### Goal
    Make semester course on precise and specialized topic of algorithmics (ML, multi-threading ...). 
  - #### Why? 
    Some people might want to learn algorithms for a precise purpose and when the first four semesters are made for learning algorithms and data structures in general having specialized semester could be useful. 

  _No issues or project defined for this for now as it is for later in the roadmap (for when the community around the project will not be just me)._

### Translations
  - #### Goal
    Translate the course in other languages than English.
  - #### Why? 
    Because not everyone is a good English speaker. 

  _No issues or project defined for this for now as it is for later in the roadmap (for when the community around the project will not be just me)._
