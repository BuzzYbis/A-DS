# Algorithm & Data Structure

## What is it ? 

[Algorithm and Data Structure](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS21S1jm43igE57Ye_edwds_iL7ZOAG4) is a wonderfull course on algorithms and data structures made by Pavel Marvin from ITMO university. 

The course is on youtube and almost every Episode come with it's own home task to achieve. 

The objective of this repository is to gather my course notes and my solution to the home tasks. Tho, I encourage you vividly to look at the videos from Pavel Marvin and try to solve the home tasks by yourself even if you read my notes and solutions. 

_Note: that since I am not a Russian speaker, I followed the english course but it is also available in Russian._ 

## Presentation 

This course is articulated in 4 semesters which represent 59 videos (almost 15 per semester) and 2 bonus videos. 

This repository contain the `Typst` code source of all my notes. 

To get the PDF compiled version of this notes see the release. One will be made each I finish all the Lecture of a semester and each time I finish all the Home-task of a semester. 

When I will have completed all the Lecture and Home-task. I will make a release each year through the June/July month for people to have an up-to-date version each academic year, since some country have school beginning between February / April ... if the project grow and change rapidly enough, two release (January/February and June/July) will be made so that every one can begin is academic year with an up-to-date project. 

## Contribution 

Those are my personal notes and may contains mistakes, please if you find one open an issue on why this is a mistakes with sources and I will hapilly accept it. 

If some of you speak another languages than english and want to tranlate my notes, or are inspired to do the same plase contact me so we can reference it and share it with the maximum of people. 

If you want to contribute to devellop the future devellopment for this course please do so. 

To contribute, you have two choices, import the project in the Typst web app or just put the project in local and use your IDE to make your modifications. If you have VSC you can use the [Tinymist typst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extension. 

## Future 

In the future: 
* I would like to make this course evolve, add some detail to the course note from other source than the A&DS courses from Pavel Marvin.
* I would also like to add another PDF that compile Further Reading for each chapter so that people can dive into a subject.
* I would like to make slides of this course so that Professor can have a support if they want to present it or a part of it.
* I would like to make specialize part of this course, for example make a semester dedicated to ML, multi-threading, ... algorithms .
* Add in this repository or another one, implementation of the presented data structures and algorithms in some languages.
