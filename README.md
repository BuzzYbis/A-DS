# Algorithm & Data Structure

## What is it ? 

[Algorithm and Data Structure](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS21S1jm43igE57Ye_edwds_iL7ZOAG4) is a wonderfull course on algorithm made by Pavel Marvin from ITMO university. 

The course is on youtube and almost every Episode come with it's own home task to achieve. 

The objective of this repository is to gather my course notes and my solution to the home tasks. Tho, I encourage you vividly to look at the videos from Pavel Marvin and try to solve the home tasks by yourself even if you read my notes and solutions. 

_Note: that since I am not a Russian speaker, I followed the english course but it is also available in Russian._ 

## Presantation 

This course is articulated in 59 videos in 4 semesters and 2 bonus videos. 

The repository source contain the template of the semester file which is used for both ```Course notes``` and ```Home tasks```. 
This repository also contain 2 directory, 1 with the file of the note for each lesson nd 1 with the file of all the home task and the subject pdf. 

Each semester as one directory, in it, the course note code pdf and the home tasks one. 

For each semester I will make two tagged release: 
- 1 for the course notes
- 1 for the home tasks

The tag will done as follow: 
- The first number will be the last available semester
- The second will be the last home task disponible
- Third is left for the revision

For example: v3.2.7 mean that the course note are up to the third semester and the home task up to the second semester. 

## Contribution 

Those are my personal notes and may contains mistakes, please if you find one open an issue on why this is a mistakes with sources and I will hapilly coorect it. 

If some of you speak another languages than english and want to tranlate my notes on are inspired to do the same plase contact me so we can reference it and share it with the maximum of people. 

## Future 

In the future my plan is to make a bibliography going with each lesson to assert what it is said and give people that want to dive depper in a subject to be able by getting further reading.
