# Algorithm & Data Structure

## What is it ? 

[Algorithm and data structure](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS21S1jm43igE57Ye_edwds_iL7ZOAG4) is a wonderfull course on algorithm made by Pavel Marvin. 

The course is on youtube and every Episode as it's own home task to achieve. 

The objective of this repository is to gather my course notes and my solution to the home task. 

## Presantation 

This course is articulated in 61 videos and 4 semesters. 

Each semesters will have 1 dedicated directory, in it 2 pdf files 1 for the course notes 1 for the home task and 2 typst files, the source code of the pdfs. 

The repository source contain the typst sources file that allow me to compile the pdfs. 

## Contributions 

These are my notes so these will probably not be exhaustive so feel free to make a PR for adding a part that I did not included. 

Similarly, I could (probably will) have make mistakes, in the notes but most probably in my answers, your corrections / advice are welcomed.
